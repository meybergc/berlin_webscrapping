# berlin_webscrapping
All the complementary material of the publication Flat Rent Price Prediction in Berlin with Web Scraping: Towards the Digital Transformation in Official Statistics
can be found in this repository as a series of Jupyter Notebooks. Every Jupyter Notebook follows the order of each chapter of the article. In other words, from
the exploratory analysis of the data to the bayesian additive model.
