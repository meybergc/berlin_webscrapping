The complementary material of the publication Flat Rent Price Prediction in Berlin with Web Scraping: Towards the Digital Transformation in Official Statistics consists in a series of Jupyter Notebooks that illustrate the step-by-step procedure in each stage of the development of the prediction model to get the outcomes presented in the publication. Each Jupyter Notebook includes the written codes either in Python or R with its correspondent explanation and execution. The reader can go through each of them in the following order by clicking on the respective hyperlink (Optional: The reader can download each html file and open it on any web-browser):
